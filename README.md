# EntirelyNew
Another Unreal Engine project also called Chunks to build DLC content to load in the original project called Chunks that implements Chunk Downloader

## Base Project
The base project it's available [here](https://github.com/rafasloth/Chunks). Although the idea is to allow the creation of DLC for it without sharing the source code of the Base Game.

## Common Plugin
This external project uses the same common plugin available [here](https://github.com/rafasloth/ChunksCommon) also used by the base game.
